## Binary Search
Please watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3YID7liBug) for an introductary tutorial and this video 
([part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v57lNF2mb_s), [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-IQxfYRTto)) for a 
great summary of binary search. It is extremely important to **implement your own versions** of binary search 
algorithms, and make correspondence between your versions and `bisect.bisect()/bisect.bisect_right()` and 
`bisect.bisect_left()`.

## Stack and Queue
The main characteristics of stack and queue are LIFO (Last In First Out) and FIFO (First In First Out) respectively. 
Stack and queue are frequently used in tree and graph traversal problems, leveraging stack for DFS and queue for BFS. We 
will not list such problems in this list.

 ID | Problem Name | Difficulty | Similar problems | Main Idea

## Hash table and set
Hash table/set is one of the most frequently asked data structures in coding interviews. When stuck, try hash table. 
Hash table is also very useful to make time-space trade off. They enable `O(1)` time of searching. 

 ID | Problem Name | Difficulty | Similar problems | Main Idea
--- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------

## Tree
Most of tree problems are traversal problems. It is a must to master algorithms such as DFS including 'pre-order', 
'in-order', and 'post-order', and BFS or level order traversal. Generally speaking, the time complexity of DFS algorithm 
is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes and the space complexity is `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the tree due to 
implicit stack used in recursion. Additionally, BFS problems generally have complexity of `O(n)` in time and `O(w)` in
space, where `w` is the maximum width of a tree. Moreover, it is very important to know concepts such as 'depth', 
'height', 'level', 'complete', and 'perfect', etc.

[968](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/) | Binary Tree Cameras | Hard | [979](https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-coins-in-binary-tree/) | Bottom up. DFS + greedy. 


## Divide and Conquer

Divide and conquer approach refers to decomposing a big problem into smaller problems, then combine the results obtained 
from these smaller problems which are solved recursively. When stuck, think about the base case (the smallest problem), 
and see if we can build up a solution recursively from there.

[315](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-smaller-numbers-after-self/) | Count of Smaller Numbers After Self | Hard |  | Merge sort. The key is gradually updating the answer in the merge step.


## Graph

Graph problems are generalization of tree problems. DFS and BFS traversals are extremely important algorithms in graph 
problems. One key difference between graph and tree problems is that graph traversal requires a `visited` variable to 
memorize nodes that have been visited before. Moreover, use DFS to solve connected problems and BFS to solve shortest
path problems. The complexity of graph traversals is generally `O(V+E)` in time and `O(V)` in space, where `V` is the 
number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges.

## Greedy Algorithm

Greedy algorithm is a simple and heuristic algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally 
optimal choice which **might but not necessarily** end up a global optimal solution. It builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the 
next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. Sometimes, we solved a problem using our instinct without 
even realizing it is a greedy algorithm problem.

The difference between greedy algorithm and dynamic programming (DP) is subtle. Detailed comparison is highlighted in 
this [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-approach-vs-dynamic-programming/). In general, greedy algorithm is 
simpler and myopic, and make heuristic decision based on locally optimal choice. DP is generally harder, and makes 
decision at each step considering current problem and solution to previously solved sub-problems. 

In practice, a problem might be able to solved in both ways, as pointed out in
this [article](https://medium.com/algorithms-and-leetcode/greedy-algorithm-explained-using-leetcode-problems-80d6fee071c4) 
"beneath every greedy algorithm, there is almost always a more cumbersome dynamic programming solution".

## Backtracking

Backtracking is an exhaustive search algorithm for solving combination, permutation, subset, and constraint satisfaction 
problems. It solves a problem recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally while removing solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of 
the problem. The time complexity of backtracking algorithm is generally large, e.g., at least `C(n, k)` for combination 
problem and at least `P(n, k)` for permutation problem 
[reference](https://betterexplained.com/articles/easy-permutations-and-combinations/). This 
[video](https://zxi.mytechroad.com/blog/searching/leetcode-78-subsets/) gives a great tutorial on how to implement 
backtracking algorithm for combination and permutation problems.

There are three key pillars in backtracking algorithms: (1) the base case, exit condition or the goal to achieve, (2) 
the choices to make to go to the next building step, and (3) pruning that discards solutions that fail to satisfy the
constraints of the problem. A great high-level introduction of backtracking algorithm can be found 
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq4upTEaQyM).

## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming (DP) is an algorithm to solve problems by breaking it down into simpler and smaller subproblems 
and utilizing the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solutions to these 
subproblems. DP algorithm is similar to Greedy and Divide & Conquer algorithms in breaking down the problem into smaller 
subproblems. However, these subproblems are not solved independently, and results of these smaller subproblems are 
remembered and used for similar and **overlapping** subproblems. 

Please watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYquumk4nWw&t=34s) for a brief introductory tutorial to DP, 
and this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mY5W0yojtA) for a great summary of DP algorithms. DP has two forms: 
top-down (recursion + memoization) and iterative bottom-up. The main goals of DP are reducing time complexity of a 
problem solved by using recursion from exponential to lower ones such as linear or finding counting and global optimal 
solution to a problem. The key to solve a DP problem is to find an iterative or recursive formula.  

Asking DP problems in coding interviews has been a little bit controversial. It is highly likely that an interviewee 
either solves the problem in several minutes or gets stuck for the whole coding session. Additionally, a lot of DP 
problems are really involved and complicated. However, DP is one of the most important algorithms in practice, and 
proven to be very useful to solve optimal control/decision problems.

## Miscellaneous

#### String

Some of the most famous string problems include anagram, palindrome, substring, and rotation. If you are not familiar 
with the definition of anagram or palindrome, it might be a good idea to understand these concepts before the interview.

#### Array

Index plays an important role in array problems. In some problems, values in array are used as indices as well. 
Quick select is a great algorithm to find the k-th smallest element in an array in `O(n)` time, which outperforms 
heap/priority queue and sorting algorithms which have time complexities of `O(nlog(k))` and `O(nlog(n))` respectively.

#### Math

Typical math problems include finding prime numbers, gcd (greatest common divisor), lcm (least common multiple), 
converting base, and check if a number is a power of 2/3/4, etc.

There are a couple of tips related to gcd and lcm.
* find gcd, `def gcd(a, b): return a if b == 0 else gcd(b, a%b)`, time complexity `O(log(min(a, b)))`.
* find lcm, `def lcm(a, b): return a*b//gcd(a, b)`.

#### Bit manipulation

Bit manipulation problems can be very tricky. If you don't know the concept, it is highly likely you will not be able to 
solve the problem, and there is generally no workaround by using other algorithms. 

The fundamental operations of bit manipulation are:
```
x ^ 0s = x      x & 0s = 0      x | 0s = x
x ^ 1s = ~x     x & 1s = x      x | 1s = 1s
x ^ x = 0       x & x = x       x | x = x
```
where `0s` and `1s` represent a sequence of 0s and 1s respectively. 

There are a few tips that might help solve bit manipulation problems.
* Leverage `x ^ 0s = x` and `x ^ x = 0`, we can remove or find duplicate number, e.g., `1^1^2 = 2`.
* `x&(x-1)` and `x&(-x)` will remove and get the last 1 in the binary representation of `x`.
* The binary representation of `-k` as a n-bit number is `concat(1, 2^(n-1)-k)`.
* In Python converting an integer represented in any base to a binary number as a **string** can be done using `bin(num)[2:]`. 
* `x << n` will multiply `x` by 2^n, and `x >> n` will divide `x` by 2^n.

## Advanced Topics

#### Trie

`Trie` is a special `tree` data structure that stores the letters of a string in an ordered manner. It enables fast 
search of a string by traversing down a branch path of the tree. It behaves as a dictionary, we can navigate to the next 
letter from the current letter. Each Trie node has a `children` variable and a `is_word` variable. The `children` 
variable is generally a hash table with letter as key and Trie node as the value, and the `is_word` variable is boolean.
There are three common methods for Trie data structure, `insert`, `search`, and `start_with`. The difference between the
`search` and `start_with` functions is the `is_word` flag is true or not after iterating through the searched string. 
When encountering key words such as `prefix`, `dictionary`, `search`, and `word`, etc. in a coding problem, think about 
the Trie data structure.

#### Topological Sorting

Topological sort is only feasible for DAG (directed acyclic graph). One way to implement topological sorting is use BFS.
First add nodes with in-degrees/out-degrees equal to 0 to queue. Then pop a node, traverse to its neighbors, and 
subtract 1 from the in-degrees/out-degrees of the neighbors. If the current in-degree/out-degree of a neighbor is equal 
to 0, add it to the queue.

#### Union Find

Union Find algorithm or disjoint-set data structure aims to find if two nodes are in the same set in amortized `O(1)` 
time. There are two operations in the `UnionFind` class: `find` and `union`. To enable amortized `O(1)` time of `find`, 
two optimizations needs to be done for the `UnionFind` class: path compression and union by rank.

A python implementation of the disjoint set data structure is given below.
```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self._parents = [i for i in range(n + 1)]
        self._ranks = [1 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    def find(self, u):
        if u != self._parents[u]:
            self._parents[u] = self.find(self._parents[u])
        return self._parents[u]
    
    def union(self, u, v):
        pu, pv = self.find(u), self.find(v)
        if pu == pv: return False
        if self._ranks[pu] < self._ranks[pv]:
            self._parents[pu] = pv
        elif self._ranks[pu] > self._ranks[pv]:
            self._parents[pv] = pu
        else:        
            self._parents[pv] = pu
            self._ranks[pu] += 1
        return True
```

**In a coding interview, when asked a Union Find problem and you are not familiar with this algorithm, try other 
algorithms such as DFS or BFS, and it is highly likely that you are still able to solve the problem.**

## How to Approach a Coding Question :heavy_check_mark:

I highly recommend to get a copy of [Gayle McDowell's](http://www.gayle.com/) coding interview preparation book 
[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850), 
and follow the recommend **seven steps** (illustrated below) to answer any coding questions.

1. **Listen carefully to the problem description and ask clarifying questions**

    Don't miss any important information/keyword which might help you find an optimal solution. Most of the times, the 
    interviewer will type the problem description into the collaborative coding environment. Do ask questions to clarify 
    all your doubts such as input, output, edge cases, and constraints, etc. Even the problem description is crystal 
    clear to you or you have solved this problem before, it is still helpful to repeat the problem to the interviewer in 
    a different way to make sure you really understand it and engage the interviewer.

2. **Present a nontrivial example if it is not given in the problem description**

    Sometimes, the interviewer will give you an example input and an expected output. Be careful, the given example 
    might be too trivial or just an edge case or purposely misses some edge cases or information that might help you 
    develop a solution to the problem. In this case, you might want to clarify with your interviewer by presenting a 
    typical and non-trivial example, and explain the expected output. This step might be consolidated with the first 
    step depending on the situation.

3. **Describe a brute force solution ASAP**
    
    Do not dive into coding immediately. First give an intuitive and naive solution and explain 
    the time and space complexity, then engage/discuss with the interviewer to see if you can optimize it. Note that you 
    need to **lead** the conversation. The motivation for this step is that it is the natural way to solve a problem 
    that you have never seen before. The interviewer cares more about how you got to the optimal solution than the 
    solution itself. If you rush to present an optimal solution immediately without any explanation, it makes the 
    impression that you have solved this problem before, and you are copying what you have memorized. Note that 
    companies try to hire developers with great problem-solving skills instead of people with good memory.
    
4. **Optimize your solution to get an optimal one**
    
    This is the most important step. You need to lead the discussion to explain why you use certain data structure 
    and/or algorithm to optimize your brute force solution, and how you get there. Thinking out loud and explaining your 
    thought process is extremely important in the coding interview process. Leverage the BUD (bottleneck, unnecessary, 
    duplicated) framework and other tips in the 
    [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)
    book. This is the part where all your practice and hard work pays off. Without sufficient practice and summarization 
    of different types and categories of coding questions, it will be challenging to come up an optimal solution to a 
    problem, especially to a problem you have never seen before.
    
5. **Walk through your optimal solution**

    Now you have an optimal solution and have explained how you get there, walk through the optimal solution with your 
    interviewer to make sure you and the interviewer understand everything. 
    
6. **Implement your algorithm and solution**

    Finally, we arrive the step of coding. Imagine you dived into coding immediately after your interviewer gave you 
    the problem description, how many important steps you have missed! Remember to write clean code and modularize your 
    code with standard variable and function names. [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and 
    [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) are great guidelines to write clean, 
    readable, and production-quality code for Python and C++ respectively. 
    
7. **Test your code**

    It is super important to initiate testing your code before your interviewer asks you to do so. First eye-balling 
    your code to see if there are any conceptual bugs such as keyword errors, incorrect indentations, inconsistent 
    variable or function names, missing colons, and indexing errors, etc. Then use small cases, special cases, and edge 
    cases to test your code. Do not panic if there are bugs. Everybody makes mistakes, and that is why we do the 
    testing. Fix the bugs carefully and gracefully.

**In a typical coding interview session, we generally need to solve one hard-level or two medium-level Leetcode 
questions in 45 minutes, including brief self-introductions and questions, etc. Therefore, use your time smartly and do 
not dogmatically follow the above 7 steps. Rather, be flexible and agile.**
